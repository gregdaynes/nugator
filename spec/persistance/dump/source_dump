   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LONDON – Tommy Fleetwood&nbsp;says he was blown away by the family atmosphere that was generated by Europe's triumphant 12-man team when he made his Ryder Cup debut this year.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old Englishman formed an unbeatable combination with his close friend&nbsp;Francesco Molinari&nbsp;of Italy in September, with the pairing dubbed 'Moliwood' winning all four of their matches together in Europe's 17 1/2 - 10 1/2 victory over the United States at Le Golf National in Paris.</p>

<p>''It's an experience that no matter how much you put into it, no matter how much you think about it, and no matter how much the other players tell you about it, you can't be ready for,'' Fleetwood said. ''You can't believe what a family you all become that week, and the thing that sticks is how together everyone is and how much you play for each other.</p>

<p>''I felt really emotional for how much we wanted it for each other, how much we played for each other and how much heart goes into it for this massive family that was Team Europe. The experiences, especially for us in such an individual game, are memories and feelings that you cherish.''</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fleetwood's teammate&nbsp;Sergio Garcia&nbsp;has backed three-time major champion Padraig Harrington to take over from&nbsp;<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/golf/european/players/Thomas+Bjorn/367">Thomas Bjorn</a>&nbsp;as Europe's captain for the next Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin in 2020.</p>

<p>''Talks seem to be heading toward Padraig,'' Garcia said. ''Every captain brings something different to the table and I am sure the next one will do the same.</p>

<p>''Padraig has been a great Ryder Cup player for us. He's played the European Tour for so many years and I think he could be a great Ryder Cup captain, and hopefully he will be one.''</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brooke Henderson is the pride of Canada, once again.</p>

<p>Henderson was named the Canadian Press female athlete of the year. It’s the second year in a row she has won the award, the third time in the past four years.</p>

<p>Henderson won two times on the LPGA in 2018, including the Lotte Championship, which she dedicated to the people involved in the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team bus crash in Saskatchewan. She also became the first Canadian to win her national open since 1973, when she prevailed at the CP Women’s Open.</p>

<p>Henderson earned 30 of 54 votes in a poll of Canadian broadcasters and editors, <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/henderson-named-cp-female-athlete-of-year-1.1231561" target="_blank">according to a TSN report</a>. Figure skater Kaetlyn Osmond and short-track speedskater Kim Boutin tied for second place with 10 votes each.</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tiger Woods will not be competing in the 2019-opening Sentry Tournament of Champions, <a href="http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/25621391/tiger-woods-open-season-hawaii-sentry-tournament-champions" target="_blank">according to an ESPN report</a>.</p>

<p>Woods has until Friday to officially declare for the event, which is on offer to all PGA Tour winners from the previous season. He hasn’t made an official statement as to whether or not he will compete, but ESPN cited “sources” saying that he has opted to skip the event.</p>

<p>Woods has not played at Kapaula Resort on Maui since 2005. He has twice won the event, in 1997 and 2000.</p>

<p>Woods is eligible for the event thanks to his victory at the 2018 season-ending Tour Championship, his first PGA Tour victory in five years. Thereafter, he competed in the Ryder Cup, going 0-4, and finished 17th in the 18-man field at his Hero World Challenge, which concluded Dec. 2.</p>

<p>Tough he hasn’t played in nearly a month, Woods has stayed active. He went to Australia to help promote the Presidents Cup, for which he is the U.S. captain in ’19. He also had a corporate day in Georgia with his club sponsor TaylorMade and worked on a golf course project in Mexico, according to ESPN.</p>

<p>Woods is most likely to make his 2019 debut at the Farmers Insurance Open, which begins Jan. 24 at Torrey Pines, where he has won eight times.&nbsp;</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A former top-100 pro golfer was arrested Wednesday on charges of&nbsp;poaching and&nbsp;unauthorized entry in a forest area&nbsp;in India.</p>

<p>The Agence France-Presse reported&nbsp;that&nbsp;Jyoti Randhawa, a 46-year-old who was ranked in the top 100 of the Official World Golf Ranking as recently as 2009, and companion, caddie Mahesh Virajdar, allegedly killed a red junglefowl in a protected area at&nbsp;Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh state.</p>

<p>"They have been sent to jail and further legal action is being taken," Ramesh Pandey, the reserve's field director, told the AFP.</p>

<p>The Uttar Pradesh Forest Department discovered Randhawa and Virajdar in the Motipur range, a protected area near where Randhawa's father owns a farm, along with the dead junglefowl, deer skin, a gun registered to Randhawa, among other items.</p>



<p>Randhawa has won six times on the Asian Tour, most recently in 2009, and once on the Japan Tour. He teed it up 14 times worldwide last year with his best finish being a T-16 at the Asian Tour's Take Solutions Masters. He is currently&nbsp;ranked No. 1,057 in the world.</p>

   <a10:updated>2018-12-26T12:38:00Z</a10:updated>
   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A week after Rory McIlroy <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/news/report-rory-mcilroy-changes-course-will-keep-euro-membership-2019">changed course</a> and decided he would play enough in 2019 to keep his European Tour membership, <em>The Associated Press</em> reported that Francesco Molinari isn't as committed to playing overseas next year.</p>

<p>Molinari told the AP that he plans to focus on the PGA Tour in 2019 and&nbsp;may not play in Europe next year until he defends his Claret Jug at The Open in&nbsp;July at Royal Portrush. Molinari's reasoning deals with schedule changes on the PGA Tour, which includes the PGA Championship moving to May and The Players switching to March.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old Italian wouldn't even confirm a commitment to the British Masters in May. Molinari's 2018 Ryder Cup partner, Tommy Fleetwood, is hosting the event next year at Hillside.</p>

<p>"I would like to play the British Masters, but it depends probably on the first couple of months of the season," Molinari said. "If I learned&nbsp;one thing this season, it is to be a bit flexible with the schedule playing two tours. With the changes, it is a bit different. Wentworth (BMW PGA) was always the first for me, but now it has moved from May to September. That might be the first regular European Tour event I play."</p>

<p>To retain membership, Molinari&nbsp;needs to play four regular European Tour events outside of the majors or World Golf Championships. There is also a new rule that would&nbsp;prevent Molinari from potentially becoming a Ryder Cup captain in the future if he gave up European Tour membership:&nbsp;"Players cannot be a European Ryder Cup captain or vice captain if they decline membership of the European Tour or fail to fulfill their minimum event obligation in any season."</p>

<p>Molinari went 5-0 last September in Paris.</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It appears "The Match" wasn't just a one-time deal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/tiger-woods-phil-mickelson-to-bring-back-the-match-for-2019-2020-after-two-golfers-sign-three-year-deal">Golf Digest reported</a> Wednesday that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson actually signed a three-year deal, meaning they will face off in head-to-head matches in each of the next two years.</p>

<p>Woods and Mickelson played the first installment of what looks to now be a series on Nov. 23 in Las Vegas. Mickelson won that day at Shadow Creek Golf Club, collecting the $9 million winner-take-all prize in 22 holes. Turner hasn't released official figures, but Golf Digest said it is believed that "The Match" drew nearly one million customers.</p>

<p>Initially, Turner charged a $19.95 pay-per-view fee, but those were refunded after a technical glitch.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether the event will return to Shadow Creek in 2019 or be played somewhere else.</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three days after Keith Foster&nbsp;<a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-course-architect-facing-prison-time-smuggling-endangered-wildlife-goods">plead&nbsp;guilty to illegally transporting goods</a> made from endangered species and other wildlife, Congressional Country Club has reportedly fired the golf course architect, who was&nbsp; previously tasked&nbsp;to lead a restoration of the club's Blue Course beginning in Fall 2019.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thefriedegg.com/congressional-lets-go-keith-foster/">The Fried Egg</a>, Congressional president Bev Lane sent this email to membership on Saturday to inform them of the decision:</p>

<p>“The permitting phase of the Blue Course restoration project will continue as planned. A list of golf course architects has been developed and initial discussions with them have already begun.”</p>

<p>The Fried Egg said it is unclear whether the club will keep Foster's $30 million restoration plan in place or not. Foster was planning on restoring the Blue Course to its original 1924&nbsp;Devereux Emmett design.</p>

<p>The Blue Course, which has hosted three U.S. Opens (most recently Rory McIlroy's win in 2011) and one PGA Championship, is scheduled to host nine PGA of America events in the next 18 years, including the 2031 PGA Championship and 2036 Ryder Cup. The first of those nine events will be the 2022 KPMG Women's PGA.</p>

<p>Foster, 60, was found to be in violation&nbsp;of the Lacey Act, which&nbsp;bans the trafficking of&nbsp;illegal wildlife or plants into the U.S. His sentencing is scheduled for March 8, 2019, and he could face up to five years in federal prison.</p>

   <a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Olympia Fields' North Course, which has hosted four major championships, is set to host the 2020 BMW Championship, according to reports by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/golf/ct-spt-olympia-fields-pga-tour-playoff-event-20181222-story.html">Chicago Tribune </a>and <a href="https://thefriedegg.com/olympia-fields-host-2020-bmw-championship/">The Fried Egg</a>.</p>

<p>The club, located in the south Chicago suburb of Olympia Fields, voted unanimously to host the FedEx Cup Playoffs event. It will mark the first PGA Tour event on the North Course since Jim Furyk won the 2003 U.S. Open. It will also be the first time since 2010-11 that Chicagoland has hosted back-to-back BMWs. Medinah's No. 3 Course will host in 2019.</p>

<p>Official dates have yet to be decided, and there is a chance there could be a new title sponsor, too.</p>

<p>The 7,205-yard, par-70 North Course, designed by Willie Park Jr., also has hosted the 1925 PGA Championship, 1928 U.S. Open and 1961 PGA Championship. Other events played on the course include the 1997 U.S. Senior Open, 2015 U.S. Amateur (won by Bryson DeChambeau),&nbsp;2017 KPMG Women's PGA Championship and five Western Opens (that event was replaced by the BMW in 2007).</p>

<p>The University of Illinois also annually hosts the Olympia Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational on the course each fall.</p>
